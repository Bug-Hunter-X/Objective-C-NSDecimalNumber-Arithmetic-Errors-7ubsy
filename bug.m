In Objective-C, a common yet subtle issue arises when dealing with `NSDecimalNumber`.  Incorrect usage of its methods, particularly when performing arithmetic operations, can lead to unexpected results and crashes.  For example, if you directly use `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/` operators with `NSDecimalNumber` objects, you'll encounter compiler errors.  You must instead employ the designated methods like `decimalNumberByAdding:`, `decimalNumberBySubtracting:`, `decimalNumberByMultiplyingBy:`, and `decimalNumberByDividingBy:`.
